# Coverage Measurement
#
# Component workflow that measures code coverage and enforces thresholds.
# Uses cargo-llvm-cov to generate coverage reports.
#
# Inputs:
#   ref: Git reference to check out (required)
#   min-line-coverage: Minimum line coverage percentage (required)
#   min-branch-coverage: Minimum branch coverage percentage (required)
#   min-function-coverage: Minimum function coverage percentage (required)
#
# Usage:
#   Called by pull-request-default.yml with 90% thresholds
